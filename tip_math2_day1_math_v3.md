### Section 1: Introduction to NLP

**Lecture Content (1.5 hours):**

1. **Definition and Scope of Natural Language Processing**
   - Explore the interdisciplinary aspects combining linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence.
   - Applications of NLP: voice recognition, text analytics, and automated translation.

2. **Historical Context and Evolution of NLP**
   - **Alan Turing (1912–1954)**: Proposed the Turing Test as a measure of machine intelligence, foundational to the development of AI and NLP.
   - **Noam Chomsky (1928–)**: Introduced the concept of generative grammar in the 1950s, revolutionizing syntactic theories. Main contributions include the Chomsky hierarchy and transformational grammar.
   - **Shift from Rule-based to Statistical Methods**: The introduction of Hidden Markov Models and later, neural networks, marked significant transitions in NLP methodologies during the 1980s and post-2000s.
   - **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Background**:
     - Developed by David Blei, Andrew Ng, and Michael I. Jordan in 2003. LDA addresses the challenges of discovering thematic patterns in large text corpora, allowing for the unsupervised classification of documents into topics.
     - **David M. Blei (1976–)**: Significantly contributed to the field of machine learning in topics related to topic modeling and Bayesian data analysis.

   - **Vector Space Model Originator**:
     - The concept of vector space in information retrieval was popularized by Gerard Salton during the 1970s.
     - **Gerard Salton (1927–1995)**: Known as the father of modern search technology, his work laid the groundwork for many of the algorithms used in search engines today.

3. **Applications and Case Studies**
   - **Healthcare**: Use of NLP in extracting patient information from unstructured data to improve diagnosis and treatment plans.
   - **Finance**: Sentiment analysis tools to gauge market sentiment and predict stock movements.
   - **Customer Service**: Chatbots in banking that handle thousands of customer interactions daily, significantly reducing operational costs and improving customer experience.

### Section 2: Algorithms and Foundations

#### Table of NLP Algorithms and Mathematical Theories

1. **Linguistic Foundations**
   - **Syntax, Semantics, and Pragmatics**: Definitions, significance, and their roles in natural language understanding.
   - **Morphological Analysis and POS Tagging**:
     - Formula for POS Tagging using probabilistic models:
       \[
       P(\text{tag} | \text{word}) = \frac{P(\text{word} | \text{tag}) \cdot P(\text{tag})}{P(\text{word})}
       \]
     - Example: Determining the most likely tag for a given word based on observed frequencies in a corpus.

2. **Mathematical Foundations**
   - **Vector Space Models and Dot Products**:
     - Discussion on how text is converted into vectors and the role of cosine similarity in determining text similarity.
     - Dot product for cosine similarity:
       \[
       \text{cosine similarity} = \frac{\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}}{\|\vec{a}\| \|\vec{b}\|}
       \]
   - **Fourier Transforms in NLP**:
     - Use in processing signals (e.g., speech analysis) and transforming text data for pattern recognition.
     - Basic Fourier Transform formula:
       \[
       X(k) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x(n) \cdot e^{-i2\pi kn/N}
       \]
     - Explanation of how frequency components relate to linguistic features.

3. **Core NLP Algorithms and Techniques**
   - **N-grams and Language Modeling**:
     - Mathematical formulation for calculating probabilities of word sequences, critical for models like N-grams:
       \[
       P(w_n|w_{n-1}) = \frac{C(w_{n-1}, w_n)}{C(w_{n-1})}
       \]
   - **Naive Bayes for Text Classification**:
     - Explanation of applying Bayes' Theorem to classify text,

 with emphasis on assumptions and limitations.

4. **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**
   - **定义与重要性**: LDA是一种主题模型，用于从大量文档集中自动识别主题。这种方法假设文档由潜在的主题分布构成，而每个主题又由一组词的概率分布构成。
   - **数学模型**:
     \[
     P(\text{topic} | \text{document}) = \frac{P(\text{document} | \text{topic}) \cdot P(\text{topic})}{P(\text{document})}
     \]
     其中 \( P(\text{topic} | \text{document}) \) 表示在给定文档的情况下，选择特定主题的概率。
   - **应用示例**: 在文档分类和信息检索中，通过识别文档集中的主题来改进搜索结果的相关性。

### Section 3: Hands-On Project Exercise (0.5 hours)
- **Building a Simple Spam Detection System Using Naive Bayes**
  - Practical implementation of discussed concepts, where participants develop a basic spam filter using a predefined dataset.

This structured approach not only provides a historical and theoretical framework but also connects these concepts with practical examples, enhancing the learning experience.
