    "\n",
    "This section provides a detailed comparison and analysis of Fourier Transforms, Bayesian probability, and vector space models in NLP. It includes mathematical principles, typical application cases, and how these techniques complement each other to enhance the performance and accuracy of NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fourier Transform in NLP**: Mainly used for processing audio signals, identifying and enhancing key frequency components through frequency analysis.\n",
    "- **Bayesian Probability in NLP**: Widely used in text classification, such as spam detection and sentiment analysis, by calculating the probability of words appearing and their conditional probabilities.\n",
    "- **Vector Space Model in NLP**: Mainly used for assessing text similarity, such as in document retrieval and clustering, by calculating the cosine similarity between documents.\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression in NLP**: Used for binary classification tasks such as spam detection, where it models the likelihood of an email being spam based on features like word frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression** vs **Naive Bayes**:\n",
    "  - Logistic Regression provides a direct probability estimate, which is beneficial in scenarios requiring clear decision boundaries.\n",
    "  - Naive Bayes, based on applying Bayes' Theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions, excels in situations with distinct class probabilities especially in text classification.\n",
    "- Both methods require careful feature selection and preprocessing to perform optimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1: Detailed Text Analysis\n",
    "**Text**: \"The benefits of apples are extensive. Besides being a source of nutrition, there's an old saying, 'An apple a day keeps the doctor away.'\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis Using NLP Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **N-grams**:\n",
    "   - This technique will analyze word sequence dependencies. For example, it could predict the likelihood of \"benefits\" following \"The\", and \"apples\" following \"of\". This is useful for understanding and generating text based on the sequence learned from this corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Naive Bayes**:\n",
    "   - If used for sentiment analysis, this technique would assess the overall sentiment of the text as positive based on the presence of positive words like \"benefits\" and \"nutrition\". It assumes the independence of each word contributing to the sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fourier Transform**:\n",
    "   - Not typically used directly for textual data, but if this text were converted to speech, Fourier Transform could analyze its audio frequencies to assist in speech recognition tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Bayesian Probability**:\n",
    "   - Could be used to calculate the probability of specific words or phrases appearing within the text based on their previous occurrences, which helps in text classification or topic modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Vector Space Model**:\n",
    "   - This model would convert the text into a vector space representation, allowing for the computation of similarities with other documents. Useful in document retrieval systems to find documents with similar content.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Logistic Regression**:\n",
    "   - Could classify the text's sentiment as positive by modeling the impact of positively connotated words like \"benefits\" and \"extensive\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Sentence Analysis\n",
    "**Sentence**: \"I want to eat an apple.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis Using NLP Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **N-grams**:\n",
    "   - Would predict the probability of each subsequent word based on the previous one(s). For example, after \"I want\", it might predict \"to\" as a likely next word based on training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Naive Bayes**:\n",
    "   - For sentiment analysis, it might analyze the sentiment as neutral or slightly positive, focusing on the presence of neutral words like \"want\" and \"eat\" and the positive connotation of \"apple\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fourier Transform**:\n",
    "   - More relevant if the sentence is spoken. It would analyze the frequency components of the spoken sentence to aid in voice recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Bayesian Probability**:\n",
    "   - Useful in predicting the likelihood of the word \"apple\" appearing in dietary-related contexts or in predictive typing technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Vector Space Model**:\n",
    "   - Translates the sentence into a vector form and could be used to find documents that discuss similar topics like eating fruit or healthy habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Logistic Regression**:\n",
    "   - Might analyze the sentiment as neutral, focusing on the commonality of the words with neutral sentiment in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparative Analysis:\n",
    "- **N-grams and Naive Bayes** are both probabilistic but differ in application: N-grams are better for understanding and generating text based on sequences, while Naive Bayes is typically applied to classification tasks.\n",
    "- **Fourier Transforms** are less directly applicable to text unless it is transformed into an audio format.\n",
    "- **Bayesian Probability and Vector Space Models** provide foundational techniques for a variety of NLP applications from topic modeling to document similarity assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis not only showcases how each method would handle the given text and sentence but also highlights their strengths and limitations in practical scenarios, illustrating the broad range of methodologies in NLP and their specific applications depending on the context and the nature of the data being analyzed.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Dataset\n",
    "For this exercise, we will use a publicly available dataset of SMS messages that have been labeled as either 'spam' or 'ham' (non-spam). This dataset is commonly used in text processing and provides a good mix of text types and formulations.\n",

    "### Naive Bayes Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Calculating Probabilities for the Spam Message:\n",
    "Let's assume:\n",
    "- The word \"FREE\" appears in 80% of spam emails and 10% of non-spam emails.\n",
    "- The overall probability of any email being spam is 30% (i.e., \\( P(\text{spam}) = 0.3 \\)) and non-spam is 70% (i.e., \\( P(\text{non-spam}) = 0.7 \\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numerator for Spam**:\n",
    "- \\( P(\\text{\"FREE\"} | \text{spam}) = 0.8 \\)\n",
    "- \\( P(\\text{spam}) = 0.3 \\)\n",
    "- Product: \\( 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numerator for Non-Spam**:\n",
    "- \\( P(\\text{\"FREE\"} | \\text{non-spam}) = 0.1 \\)\n",
    "- \\( P(\\text{non-spam}) = 0.7 \\)\n",
    "- Product: \\( 0.1 \times 0.7 = 0.07 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Denominator** (Total Probability of \"FREE\"):\n",
    "- \\( P(\\text{\"FREE\"}) = (0.8 \\times 0.3) + (0.1 \\times 0.7) = 0.24 + 0.07 = 0.31 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Probability of Spam given \"FREE\"**:\n",
    "- \\( P(\\text{spam} | \\text{\"FREE\"}) = \\frac{0.24}{0.31} \u0007pprox 0.774 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Calculating Probabilities for the Non-Spam Message:\n",
    "Assuming the message doesn’t contain typical spam words like \"FREE,\" we adjust the probabilities accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numerator for Spam**:\n",
    "- \\( P(\\text{not \"FREE\"} | \\text{spam}) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 \\)\n",
    "- \\( P(\\text{spam}) = 0.3 \\)\n",
    "- Product: \\( 0.2 \\times 0.3 = 0.06 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numerator for Non-Spam**:\n",
    "- \\( P(\\text{not \"FREE\"} | \\text{non-spam}) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 \\)\n",
    "- \\( P(\\text{non-spam}) = 0.7 \\)\n",
    "- Product: \\( 0.9 \\times 0.7 = 0.63 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Denominator** (Total Probability of not \"FREE\"):\n",
    "- \\( P(\\text{not \"FREE\"}) = (0.2 \\times 0.3) + (0.9 \\times 0.7) = 0.06 + 0.63 = 0.69 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Probability of Spam given not \"FREE\"**:\n",
    "- \\( P(\\text{spam} | \\text{not \"FREE\"}) = \\frac{0.06}{0.69} \u0007pprox 0.087 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "- **With \"FREE\" in the message**, the Naive Bayes classifier shows a high probability of being spam (approximately 77.4%).\n",
    "- **Without \"FREE\" in the message**, the probability significantly drops (approximately 8.7%), indicating it's likely not spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples illustrate how Naive Bayes uses word probabilities conditioned on the class (spam or non-spam) to determine the overall likelihood of an email belonging to a certain class based on the presence or absence of certain keywords.\n",

    "  - \\( y \\) is binary, taking values in {0, 1}, where 0 might represent 'non-spam' and 1 'spam'.\n",
    "  - \\( x_1, \\dots, x_n \\) are the features extracted from the email, similar to logistic regression, covering all real numbers depending on how the features are defined and normalized.\n",
    "- **Range**: Similar to logistic regression, the range of \\( P(y | x_1, \\dots, x_n) \\) is between 0 and 1, as it represents a probability.\n",
